## La Cospirazione Stellare
In [[notes/World Atlas/Eglaria|Eglaria]], there exists a secretive and influential organization known as "La Cospirazione Stellare," which translates to "The Stellar Conspiracy." Inspired by the Italian mafia, this clandestine group operates in the shadows, utilizing a network of connections, cunning strategies, and formidable power to manipulate events throughout the land.

## Core Aspects of La Cospirazione Stellare:

**Structure and Hierarchy**: The organization operates with a strict hierarchical structure. At its helm is a secretive inner circle known as "La Stella Nera" (The Black Star). Below them are "Caporegimes" (captains), each overseeing various territories and criminal activities. Members within the organization are referred to as "Stellari" (Stellars).

**Criminal Enterprises**: La Cospirazione Stellare is involved in a wide range of criminal activities, including smuggling, extortion, illegal gambling, drug trafficking, and contract killings. They are skilled at hiding their operations and often use legitimate businesses as fronts to mask their illicit activities.

**Code of Silence**: Similar to the traditional Omert√†, the Stellari adhere to a strict code of silence and loyalty. Betrayal or sharing information with outsiders is met with severe consequences. The phrase "Sotto la Stella" (Under the Star) is used to signify that all members are under the jurisdiction of the organization's control and must obey its rules.

**Symbolism**: The Black Star serves as the symbol of the organization, often found discreetly marked on buildings, objects, or even skin. It represents the ever-watchful eye of the Stellari and the far-reaching influence of the conspiracy.

**Power and Influence**: La Cospirazione Stellare seeks to control significant aspects of [[notes/World Atlas/Eglaria|Eglaria]], aiming to have a hand in politics, commerce, and even elements of the justice system. Their web of influence extends to high-ranking officials and influential figures, allowing them to evade prosecution and expand their reach.

**Shadow Wars**: The organization engages in covert conflicts with other powerful factions, including rival criminal groups and even some of the divine organizations. Their connections and intelligence make them formidable opponents in their bid for supremacy.

**Recruitment and Initiation**: Prospective members must undergo a rigorous initiation process, proving their loyalty and skills to the organization. Once accepted, they are bound by oath and become part of the vast web of the conspiracy.

Familial Ties: Like the traditional Italian mafia, La Cospirazione Stellare values family bonds. Many members have relatives who are also part of the organization, creating a sense of loyalty and unity among its ranks.
