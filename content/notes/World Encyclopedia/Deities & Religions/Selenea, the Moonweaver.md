Goddess of the moon, dreams, and prophecy

In the distant epochs when the world was enshrouded in mystic darkness, there arose a celestial being of ethereal beauty and profound wisdom named Selenea, the Moonweaver. Adorned in silver and starlit robes, she was the embodiment of the moon's luminous glow and held sway over dreams and prophecies. Selenea's presence was calming and enigmatic, her celestial light guiding mortals through the shadowed realms of night.

The legend of Selenea's origins traces back to an ancient celestial event when the moon itself cast a beam of enchanting light upon a sacred grove.
